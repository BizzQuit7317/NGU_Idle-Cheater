# NGU_Idle-Cheater
- This repo should gives players who want to alter their NGU Idle games without using cheatEngine or having to search for the correct address. This is only a small add-on I own nothing here ESPECIALLY not the game, please support the offical game on Steam at https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147690/NGU_IDLE/
- And support the developer 4g at https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=_ASC&supportedlang=english&developer=4G
- **Also dont forget to switch off live leadersboards in settings if you use this!!!**

# Running
- Both python scripts work, howver main_v2.py takes an age to run. This is why the latest version are in the rust folder.
- In the rust script make sure to manually set the target_value in address_book.
